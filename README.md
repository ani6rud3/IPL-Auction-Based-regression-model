Machine Learning Algorithm

Creating a regression model for the IPL auction involves a multifaceted approach leveraging various technologies and tools. Python stands out as the preferred programming language owing to its extensive array of libraries tailored for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning. Core libraries such as NumPy and pandas are indispensable for data preprocessing tasks, while scikit-learn provides a comprehensive suite of machine learning algorithms including regression models.

The initial phase entails data collection, where historical data on players, their performances, auction prices, and team strategies are gathered. This data may be acquired from diverse sources including APIs, databases, or through web scraping using tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy. Once collected, the data undergoes preprocessing using pandas, involving tasks such as cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
